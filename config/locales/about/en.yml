      description: "After a degree in engineering during which I accumulated a significant scientific background and discovered the world of programming, I wanted to move forward to web development and make it my job.
                    As a perfectionist, eternal curious and passionate about science and technology, I am constantly learning and looking for new challenges.
                    I try at my scale to make the internet better."
